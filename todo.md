Things to do for the application, organized by entry dates.

## 2024/06/06 - UEI registration

For the UEI (*Unique Entity ID*) registration with [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov), we would need the following information from PROSE:

- [ ] **Legal Business Name**.
  It must match with the name in the state filing office (or tax documents). <br> 
  Currently assumption value: `Prose Technology Co. Ltd.`
- [ ] **Doing Business As**.
  This is the common name that the business adopts. <br> 
  Currently assumption value: `Prose`
- [ ] **Physical Address**.
  This should be the company's primary mailing address in the US. It cannot be a P.O. Box. <br>
  Currently assumption value: `550 Clark Dr, Budd Lake, NJ 07828, USA`
- [ ] **Start Year**.
  This is the year in which Prose legally establish itself as a business. It is also sometimes referred to as "**Year of Incorporation**" <br>
  Currently assumption value: `2022`
- [ ] **State of Incorporation**.
  Pick the State in which Prose legally operates under. It should also be the state where Prose files its State Taxes. <br>
  Currently assumption value: `New Jersey`

To prove the validity of the previously mentioned information, Prose will need to provide legal documents that will display:
- [ ] **Legal Business Name** and **Physical Address** in the same document
- [ ] **Legal Business Name** and **Doing Business As** name in the same document
- [ ] **Legal Business Name** and **U.S. State of Incorporation** in the same document
- [ ] **Legal Business Name** and **Start Year** in the same document

The *State Tax* document of Prose would be the best option for providing validity of all the information. <br>
But otherwise, the following are also accepted as pieces of proofs:
- Certiﬁed articles of incorporation information
- Certiﬁed business ﬁling from your Secretary of State's office
- Employer Identification Number (EIN) assignment letter from the IRS
- Recent bank statement (redacted, less than ﬁve years old)
- Recent utility bill (less than five years old)
